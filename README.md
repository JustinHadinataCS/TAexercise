# Animal Class

This Java project demonstrates the implementation of an Animal class that satisfies three out of four Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.

## Animal Class

The `Animal` class represents a generic animal and contains attributes such as name and age, along with getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes. It also includes an abstract method `makeSound()` for producing animal sounds.

## Driver Class

The `Driver` class serves as a test driver for the `Animal` class. It creates an instance of `Animal`, modifies its attributes using setter methods, retrieves and displays the updated information using getter methods, and calls the `makeSound()` method to demonstrate abstraction.

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

1. **Inheritance**: The `Animal` class can serve as a parent class for more specific animal types, inheriting its properties and methods.
2. **Encapsulation**: The attributes `name` and `age` are encapsulated within the `Animal` class, ensuring data integrity through getter and setter methods.
3. **Abstraction**: The `Animal` class contains an abstract method `makeSound()`, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.
